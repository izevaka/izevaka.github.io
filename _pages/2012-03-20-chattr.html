Welcome to the official place on the Internet for ChattR - the iPhone JabbR client. For general chit chat about this app you can go here: [ChitChattR](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/ChitChattR). You can also go to the room using ChitChattR app - server **jabbr.net**, room **ChitChattR**. 

[Version 0.9](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/chitchattr/id512113875?mt=8) is now available in the AppStore. Here are the featues in a nutshell:

- Fast 
- Real-time updates 
- Multiple servers 
- Room listing with a count of people inside 
- Pull to refresh older messages 

Version 0.9 provides only the most basic functionality and as such it is missing an ability to click links that are inside messages. This is high on the priority list for v.1.0.

The twitter JabbR client, as much work as it has been for me, is only the tip of the iceberg and it wouldn't be possible without these open source projects:

* [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR).
* [JabbR](https://github.com/davidfowl/JabbR).
