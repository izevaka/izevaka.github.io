My name is Igor Zevaka and I am a software engineer in Sydney, Australia. 

I used to specialise in developing in C++ on Windows and .NET. These days I have both work and personal projects spanning all technologies from Ruby and Python to Objective-C. 

I am now working for [FetchTV](http://www.fetchtv.com.au/) building online services for IPTV.

Just in case you missed the sidebar, I am a keen StackOverflower and my profile can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/users/129404/igor-zevaka).

My professional interests include high performance systems, agile management, automated testing, Behaviour Driven Design and generally things that make software development as frictionless as possible and deliver most value to the people paying for it.
