I was looking around for a domain name for this site and also for another project that I want to start and invariably the best domain names have been taken.

I can understand legitimate businesses having a domain name I have in mind, but 99% of the pages I tried were either parked or dead with the domain name unavailable.

The best of the lot would have to be this page: <a href="http://iwant.com">iwant.com</a>. In case it changes by the time this gets around, the asking price was $15 million. It also listed the following domain names that have been sold recently for lots of dough:

1) Invest.com:                 $1.00 million
2) Topix.com:                  $1.00 million
3) Guy.com:                    $1.00 million
4) Fish.com:                    $1.02 million
5) Cruises.co.uk:             $1.10 million
6) Chinese.com:             $1.12 million
7) Kredit.de:                   $1.17 million
8 ) Scores.com:               $1.18 million
9) Vista.com:                  $1.25 million
10) Cameras.com:           $1.50 million
11) Tandberg.com:          $1.50 million
12) Datarecovery.com:    $1.65 million
13) Auction.com:             $1.70 million
14) Fly.com:                    $1.76 million
15) Seniors.com:             $1.80 million
16) Computer.com:          $2.10 million
17) Creditcards.com:       $2.75 million
18) Vodka.com:               $3.00 million
19) Candy.com:               $3.00 million
20) Wine.com:                 $3.30 million
21) Altavista.com:            $3.30 million
22) Korea.com:                $5.00 million
23) Asseenontv.com:        $5.00 million
24) Toys.com:                   $5.10 million
25) Casino.com:               $5.50 million
26) Business.com:            $7.50 million
27) Diamond.com:            $7.50 million
28) Porn.com:                   $9.50 million
29) Fund.com:                  $10.0 million
30) Sex.com:                    $12.0 million
31) Moneyusa.com:          $15.0 million (Not verified)

Out of the 16 of the above sites that I tried 4 were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_traffic">Type-in traffic</a> ad farms.

Am I missing something or is the whole internet advertising bubble full of hot air? Surely investing into a generic domain name for that much will not pay off in the matter of decades. I would imagine that in order to get $1 advertising dollar the site would have to make at least double that in revenue for the advertiser. When will cameras.com generate (at least) 2 million dollars of sales for people advertising on cameras.com? In about a thousand years, if the internet still exists then.

Going with the example of cameras.com urlappraisal values the site at $31K - <a href="http://www.urlappraisal.net/search.php?textSearch=cameras.com&amp;searchSubmit=Appraise">link here</a>. Seems like whoever forked off cool $1.5M paid too much. Can't say I feel sorry for them.

Then again, the front page made by a cyber-squatter is hardly a reliable source of information, in which case this whole article becomes moot. The question still remains though - Does the internet advertising generate THAT MUCH revenue for the advertiser or is this some sort of inverse pyramid still powered by Google IPO?
