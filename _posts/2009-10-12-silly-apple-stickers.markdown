I love apple fanboy bashing. They are so lame and such easy targets. Disclosure: I own an iPhone and if I am to get a laptop I would get an Apple. Still, I sometimes find it amusing when people slap stickers that came with their Apple product on things that are not remotely Apple or even computers. The two that I snapped up were on a car and on a bike. I guess people wish there was an iCar or an iBike. But then it would only run on iPetrol that would cost double the normal price and can only travel between Paddington and Surry Hills...
