They discussed bing.com in the latest episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/202">This Week in Tech</a>. The was a brief mention that the name was genius - that it can be easily made a verb. As in "Lets bing that" - pointing out that Microsoft probably wants the name to become a generic like google. The joke was what would be the past tense - "bang"?

I thought that was a good point and I would like to expand on that. Let me draw a parallel to the verb "sing". The past tense of that is "sang", so the original suggestion that "bang" is the past tense of "bing" holds true. The present perfect tense would therefore be "bung".

So, comparing to google we have:

Present perfect:
Google: "I've already googled that restaurant we are going to tonight and the menu..."
Bing: "I've already bung that restaurant we are going to tonight and the menu..."

Past:
Google: "I googled the restaurant we are going to tonight and the menu..."
Bing: "I bang the restaurant we are going to tonight and the menu..."

Or we could have more fun with it in the following context:

Google: "I googled your ex-boyfriend and he's a bit of a loser".
Bing: "I bang your ex-boyfriend and he's a bit of a loser".

Hmmmm.....

Still going with the "sing" comparision, the corresponding noun is "song". So, in bing's case it would be "bong". That makes sense, you sing a song, so when you bing, you are binging the bong. They should rename "Search results" to "Bong" like so:
