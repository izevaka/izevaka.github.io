Seems like there is quite a bit of brouhaha going on over Atwood's [Please Don't Learn how to code post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html). Case in point:

<a href="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-16-at-9.50.11-AM.png"><img src="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-16-at-9.50.11-AM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2012-05-16 at 9.50.11 AM" width="419" height="850" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561" /></a>

I have yet another view on this matter, that disagrees equally with everybody. Consider the following contrived diagrams that I will use to prove my point. Some people in the "You must learn how to program" have the following world view:

<a href="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/programmers_perspective.png"><img src="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/programmers_perspective.png" alt="" title="programmers_perspective" width="485" height="472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-563" /></a>

Whereas the reality is more like this:

<a href="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/world.png"><img src="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/world.png" alt="" title="world" width="472" height="472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562" /></a>

I think the message we should be sending should be "Coding is **easy**", not "You **should** learn to code". With the message out there, I trust the educators pick programming up and use it as a means to an end, rather than for its own sake.
