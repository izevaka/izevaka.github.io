Inspired by Kevin Rose talking about digg_2000 on TWiT(<a href="http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/TWiT_214">http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/TWiT_214</a>) I decided to follow ...it (i think it's it).

I clearly remembered the username being digg_2000, so I decided to use Find People feature to do so:

<a href="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/digg_2000.png"><img src="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/digg_2000.png" alt="digg_2000" title="digg_2000" width="366" height="153" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119" /></a><br /><br />

Hmm... OK, must have gotten the underscore wrong, so I searched for "digg 2000":

<a href="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/digg-2000.png"><img src="http://www.somethingorothersoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/digg-2000.png" alt="digg 2000" title="digg 2000" width="377" height="167" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119" /></a><br/><br/>

Gotta say that's pretty spooky considering the conversation on TWiT was about digg_2000 being on the Suggested User List for a while and then being taken off it. Possibilities for corruption and misuse of this clearly powerful feature have been discussed as well.

So now that digg_2000 is taken off the SUL, you can't search for it either!!! Also, if you search for digg, digg_2000 is not there either. Perhaps a bug in Twitter?
