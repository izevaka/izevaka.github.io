OK, they are not really vultures, they are all nice people, but it still cracks me up. Perhaps that's too Australian, "makes me laugh" might be a better expression.

On my last day at Cognethos the fate of my computer was decided before lunch. It's a fairly new and powerful box, so one of the guys claimed it. So I was at the door at the end of the day, saying goodbye, and my computer got disconnected and moved - before I even left!

Fair enough, I thought, a couple of minutes later someone else goes to me: "Do you think it would be rude if I grab your monitor whilst you are still here?"
